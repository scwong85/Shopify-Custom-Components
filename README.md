Shopify Customizable Section Components

In this just the collection of components I created when helping my clients to customize their Shopify webstores.

To add the desired component, create a new section file in the Shopify Theme Section folder. Copy the codes from the desired component and paste them into the newly created section file. 

The component/section can now be added from Shopify Customize Theme interface. In OS2.0. if the page template is created with JSON template, these components can be added to the page too.

List of components:
- Tab Collection Slides
- Flex Box with Image and Link
- Sticky Collection Info (Desktop only)
- Accordion List
- Flex Flip Card with Image and Link
- Metro Style Info Box
- Parallax Image Container
- Image and Text Collage (re-arrange the order of text or images in Shopify Customize Theme interface to get the collage effects you desired)
- Image Unveil When Visible
- Accordion Collection Showcase
